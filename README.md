# SnapWorkout
Snap Workout is an open source fitness android app for people who don't need much but just want to be in shape and have little or now time to spend on going to the gym.
It guides users in a 7 minutes exercise session and then record each completed session locally in your device.

It was built using the following:
1: Kotlin for android
2: Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations which gives the app a faster response and better battery efficiency
3: Room DB for storing exercise history locally so users can track daily exercises
4: ViewBinding which also improves the apps performance

Snap Workout also provides BMI calculations for users to monitor their weights.
